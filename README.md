# NashvilleBusTracking
This is an interactive map that utilizes a timer to show the bus route stops in my part of town, Nashville, TN!

Once the application loads, we will see the bus route stops cycle in order as the bus moves on in its route throughout the day.

I would love to improve the map to display the best/closest Mexican restaurant that is within walking distance of each bus stop as it moves along. Nashville has a wonderful Mexican/hispanic population that contributes greatly to the unique indentity of our area in the city (one of the ways the food they make, I love it!)
